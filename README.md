Graphing calculator propably

## Instalation
Only thing you need to do is copy the contents of ```imconfig-SFML.h``` to your ```imconfig.h``` file. (to be able to cast ```ImVec2``` to ```sf::Vector2f``` and vice versa). It's also an option that you are not using Linux, then you have to link OpenGL in a diffrent way (as default flag -lGL is added in ```CmakeList.txt```).
